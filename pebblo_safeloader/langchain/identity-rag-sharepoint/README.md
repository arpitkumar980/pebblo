For the  loader changed we need to add config values with o365 credentials

`O365_CLIENT_ID = ********************`

`O365_CLIENT_SECRET = ************************`

`O365_TENANT_ID = **********************************`

Also need to install all  requirements.txt packages

These are the following inputs we need:

def_folder_id = "<sharepoint_folder_id>"
def_folder_path = "<sharepoint_folder_path>"
def_file_id = "<sharepoint_file_id>"
def_site_id = "<sharepoint_site_id>"
